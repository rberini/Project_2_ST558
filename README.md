The **Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset** provides a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification. It contains 700 samples of user data, including metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption. Each entry is categorized into one of five user behavior classes, ranging from light to extreme usage, allowing for insightful analysis and modeling.

Data dictiomnary:

`user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
`device_model`: Model of the user's smartphone.
`operating_system`: The OS of the device (iOS or Android).
`app_usage_time_min_day`: Daily time spent on mobile applications, measured in minutes.
`screen_on_time_hours_day`: Average hours per day the screen is active.
`battery_drain_m_ah_day`: Daily battery consumption in mAh.
`number_of_apps_installed`: Total apps available on the device.
`data_usage_mb_day`: Daily mobile data consumption in megabytes.
`age`: Age of the user.
`gender`: Gender of the user (Male or Female).
`user_behavior_class`: Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns (1 to 5).
